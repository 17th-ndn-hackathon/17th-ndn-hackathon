[//]: # (### Action Items DURING the Hackathon)

- **Hack!**

    Focus on proof of concept and demonstrating feasibility rather than polish.

    Note that documentation and tutorial projects should include running example code.

- Document Your Project

    Include:

    - team members
    - problem statement(s)
    - approach(es)
    - what does and does not work
    - future TODOs, and opportunities for future collaboration.

    Documentation projects should describe the initial state, what kinds changes were made
    (e.g., how-tos guides, enhanced code comments, improved developer guides, etc.).

- Present your project to the panel of judges

    We encourage every team member to present their contribution.
    Projects will be judged on the content of their project and presentation.
