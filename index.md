# 17th NDN Hackathon
We are hosting a two-day NDN Hackathon (April 18-20, 2025). The event is open and free to participate in
and winners will receive exciting prizes! This event targets all levels of participants and,
particularly for beginners, will be an excellent opportunity to get started with NDN.

participants who wish to work on them!
